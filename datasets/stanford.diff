On the two versions of the Stanford data there is a disclaimer about
the difference between the two. I was wondering if it would be helpful 
to simply list the typos that appear in the Kalbfleish and Prentice data. 
Here they are in case you don't have them:
In the K&P data IDs 16,32,35 and 37 appear twice. Cross checking with
the Crowley and Hu data shows the duplicates to be :
ID 16 with AGE=56 should be ID 18
ID 32 with AGE=41 should be ID 52
ID 35 with AGE=52 should be ID 55
ID 37 with AGE=41 should be ID 57
