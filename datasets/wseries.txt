These data tell whether or not the home team won for each game played in all
World Series prior to 1994.  The data appear as the STATS Challenge for Issue

Below are data on wins and losses for all World Series games, starting in 1903
and ending in 1993.  (There was no World Series in 1904.)  For each year the
data are presented from the point of view of the eventual winner.  A capital L
means that the eventual Series winner lost at home; a lower case l means they
lost on the road.  Likewise, a capital W means that the eventual Series winner
won at home and a lower case w means that they won on the road.

Note that in 1903, 1919, 1930, and 1921 the contests were best-five-out-of-nine
series; in other years they are best-four-out-of-seven series.

Here are a few questions you might consider as you analyze these data:

1) Is there a constant probability of winning within a given series, or is
there evidence of, e.g., a home field advantage?

2) Is there independence in the outcome from game to game?  If not, is there a
simple kind of conditional independence from game to game?

Some authors have found a propensity for the team that has just lost to win the
next game. What do you think?

L= loss at home
l= loss on road
W= win at home
w= win on road
